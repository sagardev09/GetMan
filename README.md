# 🔥 API Testing Dashboard

A lightweight, browser-based API testing tool (like Postman, but simpler).  
Built with **Next.js (Frontend)** and **Appwrite (Backend)**.

Users can test REST APIs, view responses, and save requests into collections — all in a clean dashboard UI.

### 🌟 Extended Features (planned)

- Collections & folders for saved requests.
